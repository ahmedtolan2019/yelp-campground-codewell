              "One of the most famous hikes in Benguet is Mt Ulap in Itogon. With stunning mountain views, fresh air, and a sea of clouds, Mt. Ulap is frequented by both locals and tourists. The view by the campsite is truly a wonder and if youâ€™re lucky, youâ€™ll see a sea of clouds which the mountain was named for. By the way, the camping fee is good for a group of seven.
